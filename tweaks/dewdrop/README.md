## v0.0.1
Initial release, has some bugs where banners might be darker when using themes that have transparency.

## v0.0.2
Fixed the previous issue slightly by changing what view was affected by the colour change.

## v0.0.3
Latest release, rewritten a removed iOS 10 method which determined if the banner was banner or in the Notification Center. Currently in testing.
