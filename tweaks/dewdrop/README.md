# DewDrop

## v0.0.1
Initial release, has some bugs where banners might be darker when using themes that have transparency.

## v0.0.2
Fixed the previous issue slightly by changing what view was affected by the colour change.

## v0.0.3
Rewrote a removed iOS 10 method which determined if the banner was banner or in the Notification Center. Currently in testing.

## v0.0.4
Latest release, cleaned up the codebase and stopped the colour being added more than once, improving performance.
